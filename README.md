# AICP_TASK3

The studentâ€™s ID should be displayed at the top of the menu.
Press 1 to display the bill of slab 1 and slab 2. (Hint: In slab 1, the unit range is 0 to 100, each
unit costs Rs.10, and the data of slab 1 is in the first row of the matrix. While in slab 2, the
unit range is 101-200, each unit costs Rs.15, and the data of slab 2 is in the second row of
the matrix)
Press 2 to display the bill of slab 3.(Hint: In slab 3, the unit range is 201 to 300, each unit
costs Rs.20, and the data of slab 3 is in the third row of the matrix.)
Press any other key to exit.
Use the given source data. If you do not use it, your marks will be deducted.
Write functions to calculate and display cost for slab 1, slab 2, and slab 3 from the given
source matrix.
Units of electricity consumption are given in the form of a matrix in source data. You are
required to write user-defined functions and create a repeating menu in Python or C++ keeping
in mind the following requirements:

Source data:
(Use two-dimensional array to store the following matrix)
Instructions to write Python / C++ program:
The following function names should be used for consistency.
To calculate and display cost for slab 1: costSlab1();
To calculate and display cost for slab 2: costSlab2();
To calculate and display cost for slab 3: costSlab3();

Sample Output:
When 1 is pressed
When 1 is pressed
When anyother key is pressed, program is terminated.
